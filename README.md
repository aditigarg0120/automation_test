# Automated tests in Java with Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver #

This Repository is related to testing flight booking using Selenium and Cucumber.

Test scenarios described in the feature files located here ./src/test/resources/features/Login.feature

## Installation ##

You need to have [Java 8 JDK] installed along with [maven]

To run the tests locally with Chrome, install ChromeDriver, add its location to your system PATH and add webdriver.chrome.driver=path/to/the/driver to your local variables.

To install all dependencies, run 

```console
$ mvn clean install
```

## Running tests ##

```console
$ mvn test
```

By default, tests will run on Chrome. To change that, specify `-Dbrowser={browser}` where `{browser}` is either `chrome` or `firefox`. If you haven't added the chrome driver path to your local variables, you can add it directly in the run command with the option `-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=path/to/the/driver`.

You can also select specific scenarios to execute using `-Dcucumber.options="--tags @your_tag"`. here tag is @FunctionTests
